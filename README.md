## Introduction:
  Our project is a college matchmaking platform designed exclusively for MNNIT students. It verifies users through their college email via OTP, automatically extracting their name and registration number to ensure authenticity. Students select up to five crushes, and when a mutual match occurs, a private real-time chat is enabled. This secure and fun platform helps shy students initiate conversations and connect, all wrapped in a romantic theme perfect for the Valentine's season.
